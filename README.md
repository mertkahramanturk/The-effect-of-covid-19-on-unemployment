# The effect of Covid-19 on Unemployment
### Part-1 : Problem Description
   With the worldwide pandemic, many things have changed in our lives. The economies of the countries were also affected by this. In addition, changes were observed in the unemployment figures in our country according to the course of the pandemic. My hypothesis was that layoffs would increase in proportion to the increase in the number of cases. 
   
### Introduction to Project
   I thought that the unemployment rate was the highest in the month with the highest average number of cases and deaths. ( JUNE 12, 2021 ) I noticed that in June 2021, the unemployment level did not reveal the highest level. When I researched the reasons for this, I learned that layoffs were prohibited and unpaid leave was applied. The numbers of applications for short-time working allowance revealed the real impact experienced by month. We were able to estimate how much we were affected by the economic problems experienced during the pandemic process, as in every country.
### Effects of the Pandemic
* People who are locked in their homes have finished the sectors that offer tourism and inner city sociality.
* As the effects of the pandemic increased, exports and imports declined with travel bans.
* With the international travel bans, the tourism sector has regressed.
* Increasing government investment in health sector weakened global growth stages
* Medical supplies sold at high prices became a burden to the states.
* It has caused psychological effects that will leave a lasting impact on societies.
* It became necessary to adapt to a new order quickly by changing the social and working understanding of societies.
### Part-2 : Effects on Unemployment rate in Turkey
Increases and decreases in cases according to months were regularly observed in our country. With the increase in cases, a heavy burden began to be placed on our health system. Thus, hospital capacities began to be insufficient. So, the government has started to pursue policies to reduce the spread of the pandemic. These policies were supported by shop closures, travel restrictions and curfews. As a result of these regulations, the increase in unemployment started to increase with the number of cases. These obligatory measures were not taken into account in proportion to the number of unemployment. Because layoffs were prohibited and financial support was applied to the personnel who were on unpaid leave.
#### The tool :
* Matplotlib and pandas libraries over Python were used to graph the data. 
#### Data Sources :
*The website of the Ministry of Health was used to get covid-19 data by month.

*TUIK's website was used to obtain unemployment data.

Other datasets are attached in the project.I used 6 datasets totally and and I have 5 visuals in my project.All files are available in the project documents and graph. You can find the codes in which the graphics are matched with the data and the excel records of the data from the Code file and Data section in my project file.
